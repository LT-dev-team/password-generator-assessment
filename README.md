# Password generator app

![Design preview for this interview](./preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this password generator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- See a strength rating for their generated password
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. We provide both Sketch and Figma versions of the design, so you can choose which tool you prefer to use. Each design comes with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up. The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project. 


All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. 

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

The `/starter-code` is, as you might have figured a decent place to start!

You may decide to use a front-end framework...or not.
